			p In the same fleeting moment with the engaging participants, the objects are gradually rising and being dropped rapidly in order to create the bouncing ripples. Namiji makes use of those movements to create the distance among expectations, as a result to enhance the vertical circulations within the stair by manipulating the sound and the air. The stair looks like a wiggling vertical tunnel, so as to find the connections between vertical movements and horizontal rotations. The trio performs between well-planned arrangement and improvisation, in which they are looking for the echoes assembled by the interactions between people & objects. Those echoes developed as if they are driving a certain kind of state of purity.
			p 電光火石之間，物件緩緩地上升、急速的下墜、回彈的漣漪以及他者的介入，三人玩聲組合「波寺」利用這些元素來回地製造有偏差的期望。一起搬弄著裡面的空氣和聲音，使14層中的一切都循環著，就像蠕動著的一條垂直的隧道，再而從橫向旋轉與垂直升降之間找到連結。三人於刻意安排與即興之間遊走，以人與物件之間的互動產生不同程度的迴響，這迴響看似推動著某種純粹的狀態。

			h3 About Namiji: 關於波寺:
			p Namiji is formed by Samson Cheung, Fiona Lee and Wong Fuk Kuen. The fundamental initiation of forming the group is inspired by the trio’s common ground in their spatial sensibility. They search and discover the intangible and seemingly non-existenting aesthetics with certain distance and speed, in between here and there. Namiji is where those abstract concepts being practised and executed in form of performance, installation, field recording and journal about their senses towards different spaces, based on their fundamental initiation. Namiji could be a hub for practising, in round shape.
			p 波寺的概念來自張才生、李穎姍及黃福權，它的基調源自於三人共同擁有對空間觸覺的本能。他們都會在這裡和那裡之間，以某一種距離，某一種速度，尋找和發現看似不存在又没有形狀的美學概念。波寺是一個把這些抽象概念實踐出來的地方，建構於表演、裝置、田野錄音、或只是記錄日常生活中對空間的感受，這都是圍繞著那個基調而作出種種嘗試。波寺可以看成是一個共同修行的地方，而且是圓的。
